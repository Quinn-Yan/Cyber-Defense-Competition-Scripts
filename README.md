# [Cyber-Defense-Competition-Scripts](): Having fun playing as Blue Team.

Created by [@Tech](https://twitter.com/Tech)

Over the past few weeks leading up to competition day, I have wrote the following scripts to secure our systems in less than 5 minutes. Incase of an intrustion, we can bring systems back up with less downtime. Moreover, none of the systems below got compromised during the competition!

These include:
+ Centos OS, for our Mail Server (Using iRedMail+dovcot on centos)
+ Ubuntu OS, for our FTP Server
+ Debian OS, for our Web Server
+ Drupal Web Server
+ Windows 2008 R2 for our Active Directory
+ Bonus: The HMI that ran off a raspberry pi!

## Documentation

I have added comments to the code as it goes to give you a better understanding of what each line is doing, for more stories on this past CDC event, visit my blog!
